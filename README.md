# Logitech G600 MMO - Mouse
This is for the Logitech G600 MMO mouse, so that you can easily use AutoHotKey for advanced macros. You'll need to set the G9-G20 buttons as F13-F24, until I find a way to identify the G600 button names.

# Planned updates
 - Find a way to use the G600's native keynames, and remove the dependancy on Logitech software
 - Add a way to detect the active application window and switch to a custom set of macros for that app
 - Produce a decent splash image
 - An about page from the tray menu
 - Make a simple GUI so that non-AHK users can easily update the macros
